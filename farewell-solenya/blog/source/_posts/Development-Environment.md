When considering my perfect dev environment, the following requirements come to mind.

- It is easier to share resources, find support and generally tweak open source tools and software.
- Command line tools generally require less maintenance and use the mouse less.
- Machines get damaged, stolen and broken often. It should be easy to rebuild.
- Lightweight so that it can be run on hardware with low specs.

# Hardware

Currently I bounce between a Raspberry Pi 3, an Acer C720 Chromebook (hacked, of course), a rig I built from scratch and work machines. My Macbooks keep getting stolen so having the ability to work on a Â£30 Pi allows me not to worry about getting my door kicked in!

# Operating System

I spent many years playing with Windows, OS X and Arch Linux. I am currently using Debian (Testing) over Arch as it is more similar to the systems I may encounter at work. I am yet to see an Enterprise running Arch in production!
