---

Automated the steps provided in Ryan's article: https://modernmainframer.com/2017/01/30/so-you-want-your-own-mainframe-hercules-zarchitecture-emulator-tutorial/

I've used tmux to allow you to watch the setup as it happens.

Try it yourself!

1) Install Docker

2) Run the image

```
docker run -it seanchickenninja/mainframe

```

3) Watch the magic happen - this takes a few mins

4) Log in with user IBMUSER

Have fun!
